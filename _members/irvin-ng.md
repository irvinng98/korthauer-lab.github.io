Irvin (He/Him) is currently a MSc student in UBC's Bioinformatics program. Co-supervised by Dr. Keegan Korthauer and Dr. Bruce Vallance, Irvin's research involves the development of a novel approach which leverages machine learning to integrate and analyze microbiome and metabolomic data. To that end, he hopes to apply this approach to a fascinating project looking at the effect of diet supplementation on the gut microbiome in toddlers. In addition to his research, Irvin also provide bioinformatics support to the BCCHR's Gut4Health microbiome core.
